6. Make sure to save files (Ctrl + S)
7. Upload to real site by typing these 3 commands in terminal
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "message of what you did"`
- `git push`

Now you're done! Wasn't that easy? Just wait a few minutes for the website to build and revisit [www.justinhoong.com](https://www.justinhoong.com)

## Tips
- Before you start making changes next time make sure to run `git pull` in the terminal. This will make sure your files are in sync with the master branch (the current most updated files).
- To put images into markdown use the `![description of image](imgurl)` format. For this article, I uploaded my images to [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/KP1v5Kl) and copied the image link. To copy image link, right click the image and click "Copy image address"
